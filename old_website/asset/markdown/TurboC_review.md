# Book Review

This blog I am going to review and introduced the book that I have read and tried to  learned about C language.

The book is **Advanced Turbo C Programming (1988)** which is really old book and I have some checklists for the book which is for learning C programming and use for comparing which topics this book which don't and which that this book have but I don't.

## What Advanced Turbo C Programming (1988) Does Not Have.
  As you can see from the there is much basic stuff that you need to learn if you are new to C language but this book doesn't have a lot of them it also states that ***"This book assumes that you're familiar with the basics of C programming. It does not explain C programming fundamentals at the level you'll need if you're a new hand at C programming."*** So if you are new or just started learning C , I do not recommend this book for you.

## The Topic that This Book Have

**Getting started with C Language**

  This book it has a brief history of C and none of C++ cause of the year it was published and also how new the language is. Also, this book shows the change in C standards and the book about it which is a classic text of Kernighan and Ritchie called "The C Programming Language".

**Code Comments**

  In this part, it doesn't have it but there are examples of using them in the book on many parts

  **Data Types**

  The data types it has shown in Chapter 3 about Data Structure contain 'int', 'char',' float, and 'double' but no boolean type. Also, it showed how to use many structures like arrays enumerated unions and void types was included too.

  **Type Conversions**

  Showned some usage but doesn't explain how to use it.
  
  **Literals (constant values of specific data types)**

  Used and explain how to use the data but doesn't have compairation and doesn't have boolean.

  **Identifiers and Variables**

  Its have shown about how to define what type and constant and volatile usage in the book but doesn't have a comparison of declare and define also none of the topics of how to name variables.

  **Operators**

  On this book it use all of the operators but doesn't have an explanation and how to use them.

  **Strings**

  A lot of info about this part using string is like the main concept of the book the use of pointers and NULL are all included.
  
  **Array: 1D and 2D**

  Its using Array in many kinds like for some data structured and to store value have shown how to use it in the first Chapter.
  
  **Structs (short for structures)**
  
  On chapter 3 it showed many of data structures like Linkedlist(singly and doubly), Stack, and Binary trees and how to make them useful.

  **Union**
  
  It shown how to create and usage of Union

  **Bit-field**

  Have shown some uses in the book.

  **Enumeration (enum)**
 
  Included in the First Chapter on how to create enum.

  **Typedef for user-defined types**

  Explained how to use typedef and how we can redefine variables.
  
  **Statements such as**

  Have all of the statements we normally use such as for, while, switch case, if-else and a lot of usage.
  
  **Functions**

  Shows how to declare how the argument work and the type of it, void function and how to use them.
  
  **Pointers**
  
  How to use them and many ways to make them useful. It is like the fundamental part of learning C.

  **C Preprocessor Directives and Macros**

  This book has a table for all Macros and preprocessors which also explained how they work and when to use them.
  

  **Command-line arguments to the main() function**

  Show about argv argc and how to use command-line for running the program.

  **The C Standard I/O library**

  Contains all of the standard I/O function and explain the library used.
  
  **Files and I/O streams**

  All about Files and I/O streams are included in this book which I think it really useful if your gonna work with this part of programming and also uit have a routine for practice yourself too.



  **Interprocess Communication (IPC)**

  Only pipes introduce in this book.


  **Memory management (Heap Usage)**

  Heap is use in this book and the function for memory allocate the too and there function too like 'malloc()','colloc()', 'realloc", 'free()'

  **Common C programming idioms and developer practices**

  In the book, it says you have 2 main concepts of writing code that are to be readable and portable. And it shows how the code properly writing to be readable.
  
  **Common Pitfalls**

  Not really state on one topic but separately talk about when we in the topic and some of how to handling with them.
  
 **GUI-based Application Development (with C/C++)**
  
  In this book, the last 2 Chapters are about Video and creating UI which easily for user to use.

## Topic I want to put in the checklist after reading the book.

After finishing the book I know that this book has special pointers which I think I would like to add them because of pointers in unique for C programming. The next thing is the routine of programming which it state how you should write and work with them if you want to master and a topic about Console I/O and low-level I/O. And the last one is about graphic coding and functions of them.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this book is not bad but it is out of date some of the features it state are popular on this day. And the style of the book is boring a lot of plain text and code but the content of it isn't bad like the data structure , I/O and UI part is really nice to read if you want to use it. So overall I would say if you wanna learned and tried these topics the book is great for you.
